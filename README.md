â”‚â”€â”€ GAT/ # Graph Attention Network experiments
â”‚â”€â”€ GCN/ # Graph Convolutional Network experiments
â”‚â”€â”€ GIN/ # Graph Isomorphism Network experiments
â”‚â”€â”€ GRAPHSAGE/ # GraphSAGE experiments

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using both **machine learning metrics** and **business-oriented metrics**.

- **Loss**: Optimization objective value (lower is better).  
- **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)**: Measures the ability to rank churners vs. non-churners (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect).  
- **AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)**: Focuses on the modelâ€™s precision for the positive churn class, especially important in imbalanced datasets.  

### Lift Metrics
Lift measures how well the model identifies churners in the top fraction of ranked predictions:  
- **lift_0005** â†’ Top 0.05%  
- **lift_001** â†’ Top 0.1%  
- **lift_005** â†’ Top 0.5%  
- **lift_01** â†’ Top 1%  
(A lift of 1.0 = random selection, higher values indicate better targeting.)

### Business-Oriented Metrics
Implemented using the [EMP-PY package](https://pypi.org/project/EMP-PY/):  
- **EMP (Expected Maximum Profit)**: Estimates the maximum profit achievable when applying an optimal retention campaign.  
- **MP (Maximum Profit)**: The actual maximum profit value based on the decision threshold that maximizes profit.
